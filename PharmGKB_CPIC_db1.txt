The CYP2C19 frequency table includes updates of those previously published in CPIC guidelines. Updates to the CYP2C19 frequency tables were made by searching the PubMed® database (1995 to 2015). The following criteria were used for CYP2C19: (CYP2C19 or 2C19 or cytochrome P4502C19) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve \"full-text\" and \"English\" literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the CYP2C19 frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses). Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies.

Diplotype and Phenotype Calculations. Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies.

Caveats to estimated allele, diplotype and phenotype frequencies:

Sampling. Allele frequencies collected by CPIC for the supplemental tables are based on published literature reports which typically study small groups of people based on a geographic location (e.g. Malaysia, Berlin, Cairo). Almost no studies use genetic markers to estimate ancestry. Manuscripts are often focused on a specific phenotype (e.g. disease) or study only individuals taking a particular drug. Such samples would not be considered a random sample of the general population. Another consideration is that sample size is important, and PGx studies are typically not large. The frequencies collected from these studies are then used to estimate general estimates of entire ethnic population allele frequencies. Therefore, frequencies from larger groups of subjects and frequencies averaged from many sample populations probably result in better estimates.

Estimation of *1 frequency. In general, there are no population studies that test for all known variant alleles. Because *1 is not genotyped directly in many studies, all alleles that are negative for a sequence variation are defaulted to a *1 assignment. The inferred frequency for *1 is estimated as: 100 - (sum of averaged variant allele frequencies). For genes where many alleles are not tested for in any population, and frequency of ‘common’ alleles is not well documented in many understudied populations (Oceanian, Central/South Asian, Latino), the *1 frequency will deviate even more from true values.

Diplotype/Phenotype frequency estimates. Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies. When calculating diplotype frequencies from these allele frequencies, the margin of error is compounded based on the margin of error on each allele in the diplotype. So, the margin of error will necessarily increase for diplotype frequency estimates compared to allele frequency estimates. For allele frequencies with already large margins of error due to small and non-random sampling, the diplotype margin of error could potentially be quite large. On the other hand, for well-studied alleles, the margin of error is likely low.

Biogeographical groups. Biogeographical groups are derived from PMID 30506572. Further details, including the definitions of each group, can be found at https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/biogeographicalGroups. We strongly recommend that users use either the publication or the PharmGKB link provided to familiarize themselves with the grouping system before using these allele frequencies. These tables group individuals from particular geographic locations into larger biogeographical groups. It is difficult to group populations with certainty, because some populations are often admixed, or at the least, a combination of different ethnicities. Therefore, the margin of error is increased when different subpopulations are grouped together."

The CYP2C19 frequency table includes updates of those previously published in CPIC guidelines. Updates to the CYP2C19 frequency tables were made by searching the PubMed® database (1995 to 2015). The following criteria were used for CYP2C19: (CYP2C19 or 2C19 or cytochrome P4502C19) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve \"full-text\" and \"English\" literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the CYP2C19 frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses). Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies.

Caveats to estimated allele, diplotype and phenotype frequencies:

Sampling. Allele frequencies collected by CPIC for the supplemental tables are based on published literature reports which typically study small groups of people based on a geographic location (e.g. Malaysia, Berlin, Cairo). Almost no studies use genetic markers to estimate ancestry. Manuscripts are often focused on a specific phenotype (e.g. disease) or study only individuals taking a particular drug. Such samples would not be considered a random sample of the general population. Another consideration is that sample size is important, and PGx studies are typically not large. The frequencies collected from these studies are then used to estimate general estimates of entire ethnic population allele frequencies. Therefore, frequencies from larger groups of subjects and frequencies averaged from many sample populations probably result in better estimates.

Estimation of *1 frequency. In general, there are no population studies that test for all known variant alleles. Because *1 is not genotyped directly in many studies, all alleles that are negative for a sequence variation are defaulted to a *1 assignment. The inferred frequency for *1 is estimated as: 100 - (sum of averaged variant allele frequencies). For genes where many alleles are not tested for in any population, and frequency of ‘common’ alleles is not well documented in many understudied populations (Oceanian, Central/South Asian, Latino), the *1 frequency will deviate even more from true values.

Diplotype/Phenotype frequency estimates. Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies. When calculating diplotype frequencies from these allele frequencies, the margin of error is compounded based on the margin of error on each allele in the diplotype. So, the margin of error will necessarily increase for diplotype frequency estimates compared to allele frequency estimates. For allele frequencies with already large margins of error due to small and non-random sampling, the diplotype margin of error could potentially be quite large. On the other hand, for well-studied alleles, the margin of error is likely low.

We strongly recommend that users use either the publication or the PharmGKB link provided to familiarize themselves with the grouping system before using these allele frequencies. These tables group individuals from particular geographic locations into larger biogeographical groups. It is difficult to group populations with certainty, because some populations are often admixed, or at the least, a combination of different ethnicities.

The CYP2C19 frequency table includes updates of those previously published in CPIC guidelines. Updates to the CYP2C19 frequency tables were made by searching the PubMed® database (1995 to 2015). The following criteria were used for CYP2C19: (CYP2C19 or 2C19 or cytochrome P4502C19) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve \"full-text\" and \"English\" literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the CYP2C19 frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses). Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies.

Caveats to estimated allele, diplotype and phenotype frequencies:

Sampling. Allele frequencies collected by CPIC for the supplemental tables are based on published literature reports which typically study small groups of people based on a geographic location (e.g. Malaysia, Berlin, Cairo). Almost no studies use genetic markers to estimate ancestry. Manuscripts are often focused on a specific phenotype (e.g. disease) or study only individuals taking a particular drug. Such samples would not be considered a random sample of the general population. Another consideration is that sample size is important, and PGx studies are typically not large. The frequencies collected from these studies are then used to estimate general estimates of entire ethnic population allele frequencies. Therefore, frequencies from larger groups of subjects and frequencies averaged from many sample populations probably result in better estimates.

Estimation of *1 frequency. In general, there are no population studies that test for all known variant alleles. Because *1 is not genotyped directly in many studies, all alleles that are negative for a sequence variation are defaulted to a *1 assignment. The inferred frequency for *1 is estimated as: 100 - (sum of averaged variant allele frequencies). For genes where many alleles are not tested for in any population, and frequency of ‘common’ alleles is not well documented in many understudied populations (Oceanian, Central/South Asian, Latino), the *1 frequency will deviate even more from true values.

Diplotype/Phenotype frequency estimates. Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies. When calculating diplotype frequencies from these allele frequencies, the margin of error is compounded based on the margin of error on each allele in the diplotype. So, the margin of error will necessarily increase for diplotype frequency estimates compared to allele frequency estimates. For allele frequencies with already large margins of error due to small and non-random sampling, the diplotype margin of error could potentially be quite large. On the other hand, for well-studied alleles, the margin of error is likely low.

Biogeographical groups. Biogeographical groups are derived from PMID 30506572.

We strongly recommend that users use either the publication or the PharmGKB link provided to familiarize themselves with the grouping system before using these allele frequencies. These tables group individuals from particular geographic locations into larger biogeographical groups. It is difficult to group populations with certainty, because some populations are often admixed, or at the least, a combination of different ethnicities.

The CYP2C19 frequency table includes updates of those previously published in CPIC guidelines. Updates to the CYP2C19 frequency tables were made by searching the PubMed® database (1995 to 2015). The following criteria were used for CYP2C19: (CYP2C19 or 2C19 or cytochrome P4502C19) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve \"full-text\" and \"English\" literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the CYP2C19 frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses).

Caveats to estimated allele, diplotype and phenotype frequencies:

Sampling. Allele frequencies collected by CPIC for the supplemental tables are based on published literature reports which typically study small groups of people based on a geographic location (e.g. Malaysia, Berlin, Cairo). Almost no studies use genetic markers to estimate ancestry. Manuscripts are often focused on a specific phenotype (e.g. disease) or study only individuals taking a particular drug. Such samples would not be considered a random sample of the general population. Another consideration is that sample size is important, and PGx studies are typically not large. The frequencies collected from these studies are then used to estimate general estimates of entire ethnic population allele frequencies. Therefore, frequencies from larger groups of subjects and frequencies averaged from many sample populations probably result in better estimates.

Estimation of *1 frequency. In general, there are no population studies that test for all known variant alleles. Because *1 is not genotyped directly in many studies, all alleles that are negative for a sequence variation are defaulted to a *1 assignment. The inferred frequency for *1 is estimated as: 100 - (sum of averaged variant allele frequencies). For genes where many alleles are not tested for in any population, and frequency of ‘common’ alleles is not well documented in many understudied populations (Oceanian, Central/South Asian, Latino), the *1 frequency will deviate even more from true values.

Diplotype/Phenotype frequency estimates. Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies. When calculating diplotype frequencies from these allele frequencies, the margin of error is compounded based on the margin of error on each allele in the diplotype. So, the margin of error will necessarily increase for diplotype frequency estimates compared to allele frequency estimates. For allele frequencies with already large margins of error due to small and non-random sampling, the diplotype margin of error could potentially be quite large. On the other hand, for well-studied alleles, the margin of error is likely low.

The CYP2C19 frequency table includes updates of those previously published in CPIC guidelines. Updates to the CYP2C19 frequency tables were made by searching the PubMed® database (1995 to 2015). The following criteria were used for CYP2C19: (CYP2C19 or 2C19 or cytochrome P4502C19) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve \"full-text\" and \"English\" literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the CYP2C19 frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses). Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies.

Caveats to estimated allele, diplotype and phenotype frequencies:

Sampling. Allele frequencies collected by CPIC for the supplemental tables are based on published literature reports which typically study small groups of people based on a geographic location (e.g. Malaysia, Berlin, Cairo). Almost no studies use genetic markers to estimate ancestry. Manuscripts are often focused on a specific phenotype (e.g. disease) or study only individuals taking a particular drug. Such samples would not be considered a random sample of the general population. Another consideration is that sample size is important, and PGx studies are typically not large. The frequencies collected from these studies are then used to estimate general estimates of entire ethnic population allele frequencies. Therefore, frequencies from larger groups of subjects and frequencies averaged from many sample populations probably result in better estimates.

Estimation of *1 frequency. In general, there are no population studies that test for all known variant alleles. Because *1 is not genotyped directly in many studies, all alleles that are negative for a sequence variation are defaulted to a *1 assignment. The inferred frequency for *1 is estimated as: 100 - (sum of averaged variant allele frequencies). For genes where many alleles are not tested for in any population, and frequency of ‘common’ alleles is not well documented in many understudied populations (Oceanian, Central/South Asian, Latino), the *1 frequency will deviate even more from true values.

Diplotype/Phenotype frequency estimates. Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies. When calculating diplotype frequencies from these allele frequencies, the margin of error is compounded based on the margin of error on each allele in the diplotype. So, the margin of error will necessarily increase for diplotype frequency estimates compared to allele frequency estimates. For allele frequencies with already large margins of error due to small and non-random sampling, the diplotype margin of error could potentially be quite large. On the other hand, for well-studied alleles, the margin of error is likely low.

We strongly recommend that users use either the publication or the PharmGKB link provided to familiarize themselves with the grouping system before using these allele frequencies.

The CYP2C19 frequency table includes updates of those previously published in CPIC guidelines. Updates to the CYP2C19 frequency tables were made by searching the PubMed® database (1995 to 2015). The following criteria were used for CYP2C19: (CYP2C19 or 2C19 or cytochrome P4502C19) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve \"full-text\" and \"English\" literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the CYP2C19 frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses). Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies.

Caveats to estimated allele, diplotype and phenotype frequencies:

Sampling. Allele frequencies collected by CPIC for the supplemental tables are based on published literature reports which typically study small groups of people based on a geographic location (e.g. Malaysia, Berlin, Cairo). Almost no studies use genetic markers to estimate ancestry. Manuscripts are often focused on a specific phenotype (e.g. disease) or study only individuals taking a particular drug. Such samples would not be considered a random sample of the general population. Another consideration is that sample size is important, and PGx studies are typically not large. The frequencies collected from these studies are then used to estimate general estimates of entire ethnic population allele frequencies. Therefore, frequencies from larger groups of subjects and frequencies averaged from many sample populations probably result in better estimates.

Estimation of *1 frequency. In general, there are no population studies that test for all known variant alleles. Because *1 is not genotyped directly in many studies, all alleles that are negative for a sequence variation are defaulted to a *1 assignment. The inferred frequency for *1 is estimated as: 100 - (sum of averaged variant allele frequencies). For genes where many alleles are not tested for in any population, and frequency of ‘common’ alleles is not well documented in many understudied populations (Oceanian, Central/South Asian, Latino), the *1 frequency will deviate even more from true values.

Diplotype/Phenotype frequency estimates. Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies. When calculating diplotype frequencies from these allele frequencies, the margin of error is compounded based on the margin of error on each allele in the diplotype. So, the margin of error will necessarily increase for diplotype frequency estimates compared to allele frequency estimates. For allele frequencies with already large margins of error due to small and non-random sampling, the diplotype margin of error could potentially be quite large. On the other hand, for well-studied alleles, the margin of error is likely low.

Biogeographical groups. Biogeographical groups are derived from PMID 30506572. Further details, including the definitions of each group, can be found at https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/biogeographicalGroups. We strongly recommend that users use either the publication or the PharmGKB link provided to familiarize themselves with the grouping system before using these allele frequencies. These tables group individuals from particular geographic locations into larger biogeographical groups. It is difficult to group populations with certainty, because some populations are often admixed, or at the least, a combination of different ethnicities. Therefore, the margin of error is increased when different subpopulations are grouped together."

The CYP2C19 frequency table includes updates of those previously published in CPIC guidelines. Updates to the CYP2C19 frequency tables were made by searching the PubMed® database (1995 to 2015). The following criteria were used for CYP2C19: (CYP2C19 or 2C19 or cytochrome P4502C19) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve \"full-text\" and \"English\" literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the CYP2C19 frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses). Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies.

Caveats to estimated allele, diplotype and phenotype frequencies:

Sampling. Allele frequencies collected by CPIC for the supplemental tables are based on published literature reports which typically study small groups of people based on a geographic location (e.g. Malaysia, Berlin, Cairo). Almost no studies use genetic markers to estimate ancestry. Manuscripts are often focused on a specific phenotype (e.g. disease) or study only individuals taking a particular drug. Such samples would not be considered a random sample of the general population. Another consideration is that sample size is important, and PGx studies are typically not large. The frequencies collected from these studies are then used to estimate general estimates of entire ethnic population allele frequencies. Therefore, frequencies from larger groups of subjects and frequencies averaged from many sample populations probably result in better estimates.

Estimation of *1 frequency. In general, there are no population studies that test for all known variant alleles. Because *1 is not genotyped directly in many studies, all alleles that are negative for a sequence variation are defaulted to a *1 assignment. The inferred frequency for *1 is estimated as: 100 - (sum of averaged variant allele frequencies). For genes where many alleles are not tested for in any population, and frequency of ‘common’ alleles is not well documented in many understudied populations (Oceanian, Central/South Asian, Latino), the *1 frequency will deviate even more from true values.

Diplotype/Phenotype frequency estimates. Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies. When calculating diplotype frequencies from these allele frequencies, the margin of error is compounded based on the margin of error on each allele in the diplotype. So, the margin of error will necessarily increase for diplotype frequency estimates compared to allele frequency estimates. For allele frequencies with already large margins of error due to small and non-random sampling, the diplotype margin of error could potentially be quite large. On the other hand, for well-studied alleles, the margin of error is likely low.

Biogeographical groups. Biogeographical groups are derived from PMID 30506572. Further details, including the definitions of each group, can be found at https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/biogeographicalGroups. We strongly recommend that users use either the publication or the PharmGKB link provided to familiarize themselves with the grouping system before using these allele frequencies. These tables group individuals from particular geographic locations into larger biogeographical groups. It is difficult to group populations with certainty, because some populations are often admixed, or at the least, a combination of different ethnicities. Therefore, the margin of error is increased when different subpopulations are grouped together."

The CYP2C19 frequency table includes updates of those previously published in CPIC guidelines. Updates to the CYP2C19 frequency tables were made by searching the PubMed® database (1995 to 2015). The following criteria were used for CYP2C19: (CYP2C19 or 2C19 or cytochrome P4502C19) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve \"full-text\" and \"English\" literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the CYP2C19 frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses). Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies.

Caveats to estimated allele, diplotype and phenotype frequencies:

Sampling. Allele frequencies collected by CPIC for the supplemental tables are based on published literature reports which typically study small groups of people based on a geographic location (e.g. Malaysia, Berlin, Cairo). Almost no studies use genetic markers to estimate ancestry. Manuscripts are often focused on a specific phenotype (e.g. disease) or study only individuals taking a particular drug. Such samples would not be considered a random sample of the general population. Another consideration is that sample size is important, and PGx studies are typically not large. The frequencies collected from these studies are then used to estimate general estimates of entire ethnic population allele frequencies. Therefore, frequencies from larger groups of subjects and frequencies averaged from many sample populations probably result in better estimates.

Estimation of *1 frequency. In general, there are no population studies that test for all known variant alleles. Because *1 is not genotyped directly in many studies, all alleles that are negative for a sequence variation are defaulted to a *1 assignment. The inferred frequency for *1 is estimated as: 100 - (sum of averaged variant allele frequencies). For genes where many alleles are not tested for in any population, and frequency of ‘common’ alleles is not well documented in many understudied populations (Oceanian, Central/South Asian, Latino), the *1 frequency will deviate even more from true values.

Diplotype/Phenotype frequency estimates. Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies. When calculating diplotype frequencies from these allele frequencies, the margin of error is compounded based on the margin of error on each allele in the diplotype. So, the margin of error will necessarily increase for diplotype frequency estimates compared to allele frequency estimates. For allele frequencies with already large margins of error due to small and non-random sampling, the diplotype margin of error could potentially be quite large. On the other hand, for well-studied alleles, the margin of error is likely low.

Biogeographical groups. Biogeographical groups are derived from PMID 30506572. Further details, including the definitions of each group, can be found at https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/biogeographicalGroups. We strongly recommend that users use either the publication or the PharmGKB link provided to familiarize themselves with the grouping system before using these allele frequencies. These tables group individuals from particular geographic locations into larger biogeographical groups. It is difficult to group populations with certainty, because some populations are often admixed, or at the least, a combination of different ethnicities. Therefore, the margin of error is increased when different subpopulations are grouped together."

The CYP2C19 frequency table includes updates of those previously published in CPIC guidelines. Updates to the CYP2C19 frequency tables were made by searching the PubMed® database (1995 to 2015). The following criteria were used for CYP2C19: (CYP2C19 or 2C19 or cytochrome P4502C19) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve \"full-text\" and \"English\" literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the CYP2C19 frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses). Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies.

Caveats to estimated allele, diplotype and phenotype frequencies:

Sampling. Allele frequencies collected by CPIC for the supplemental tables are based on published literature reports which typically study small groups of people based on a geographic location (e.g. Malaysia, Berlin, Cairo). Almost no studies use genetic markers to estimate ancestry. Manuscripts are often focused on a specific phenotype (e.g. disease) or study only individuals taking a particular drug. Such samples would not be considered a random sample of the general population. Another consideration is that sample size is important, and PGx studies are typically not large. The frequencies collected from these studies are then used to estimate general estimates of entire ethnic population allele frequencies. Therefore, frequencies from larger groups of subjects and frequencies averaged from many sample populations probably result in better estimates.

Estimation of *1 frequency. In general, there are no population studies that test for all known variant alleles. Because *1 is not genotyped directly in many studies, all alleles that are negative for a sequence variation are defaulted to a *1 assignment. The inferred frequency for *1 is estimated as: 100 - (sum of averaged variant allele frequencies). For genes where many alleles are not tested for in any population, and frequency of ‘common’ alleles is not well documented in many understudied populations (Oceanian, Central/South Asian, Latino), the *1 frequency will deviate even more from true values.

Diplotype/Phenotype frequency estimates. Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies. When calculating diplotype frequencies from these allele frequencies, the margin of error is compounded based on the margin of error on each allele in the diplotype. So, the margin of error will necessarily increase for diplotype frequency estimates compared to allele frequency estimates. For allele frequencies with already large margins of error due to small and non-random sampling, the diplotype margin of error could potentially be quite large. On the other hand, for well-studied alleles, the margin of error is likely low.

We strongly recommend that users use either the publication or the PharmGKB link provided to familiarize themselves with the grouping system before using these allele frequencies. These tables group individuals from particular geographic locations into larger biogeographical groups. It is difficult to group populations with certainty, because some populations are often admixed, or at the least, a combination of different ethnicities. Therefore, the margin of error is increased when different subpopulations are grouped together."

The CYP2C19 frequency table includes updates of those previously published in CPIC guidelines. Updates to the CYP2C19 frequency tables were made by searching the PubMed® database (1995 to 2015). The following criteria were used for CYP2C19: (CYP2C19 or 2C19 or cytochrome P4502C19) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve \"full-text\" and \"English\" literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the CYP2C19 frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses). Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies.

Caveats to estimated allele, diplotype and phenotype frequencies:

Sampling. Allele frequencies collected by CPIC for the supplemental tables are based on published literature reports which typically study small groups of people based on a geographic location (e.g. Malaysia, Berlin, Cairo). Almost no studies use genetic markers to estimate ancestry. Manuscripts are often focused on a specific phenotype (e.g. disease) or study only individuals taking a particular drug. Such samples would not be considered a random sample of the general population. Another consideration is that sample size is important, and PGx studies are typically not large. The frequencies collected from these studies are then used to estimate general estimates of entire ethnic population allele frequencies. Therefore, frequencies from larger groups of subjects and frequencies averaged from many sample populations probably result in better estimates.

Estimation of *1 frequency. In general, there are no population studies that test for all known variant alleles. Because *1 is not genotyped directly in many studies, all alleles that are negative for a sequence variation are defaulted to a *1 assignment. The inferred frequency for *1 is estimated as: 100 - (sum of averaged variant allele frequencies). For genes where many alleles are not tested for in any population, and frequency of ‘common’ alleles is not well documented in many understudied populations (Oceanian, Central/South Asian, Latino), the *1 frequency will deviate even more from true values.

Diplotype/Phenotype frequency estimates. Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies. When calculating diplotype frequencies from these allele frequencies, the margin of error is compounded based on the margin of error on each allele in the diplotype. So, the margin of error will necessarily increase for diplotype frequency estimates compared to allele frequency estimates. For allele frequencies with already large margins of error due to small and non-random sampling, the diplotype margin of error could potentially be quite large. On the other hand, for well-studied alleles, the margin of error is likely low.

Further details, including the definitions of each group, can be found at https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/biogeographicalGroups. We strongly recommend that users use either the publication or the PharmGKB link provided to familiarize themselves with the grouping system before using these allele frequencies. These tables group individuals from particular geographic locations into larger biogeographical groups. It is difficult to group populations with certainty, because some populations are often admixed, or at the least, a combination of different ethnicities. Therefore, the margin of error is increased when different subpopulations are grouped together."

The CYP2C19 frequency table includes updates of those previously published in CPIC guidelines. Updates to the CYP2C19 frequency tables were made by searching the PubMed® database (1995 to 2015). The following criteria were used for CYP2C19: (CYP2C19 or 2C19 or cytochrome P4502C19) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve \"full-text\" and \"English\" literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the CYP2C19 frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses). Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies.

Diplotype and Phenotype Calculations. Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies.

Caveats to estimated allele, diplotype and phenotype frequencies:

Sampling. Allele frequencies collected by CPIC for the supplemental tables are based on published literature reports which typically study small groups of people based on a geographic location (e.g. Malaysia, Berlin, Cairo). Almost no studies use genetic markers to estimate ancestry. Manuscripts are often focused on a specific phenotype (e.g. disease) or study only individuals taking a particular drug. Such samples would not be considered a random sample of the general population. Another consideration is that sample size is important, and PGx studies are typically not large. The frequencies collected from these studies are then used to estimate general estimates of entire ethnic population allele frequencies. Therefore, frequencies from larger groups of subjects and frequencies averaged from many sample populations probably result in better estimates.

Estimation of *1 frequency. In general, there are no population studies that test for all known variant alleles. Because *1 is not genotyped directly in many studies, all alleles that are negative for a sequence variation are defaulted to a *1 assignment. The inferred frequency for *1 is estimated as: 100 - (sum of averaged variant allele frequencies). For genes where many alleles are not tested for in any population, and frequency of ‘common’ alleles is not well documented in many understudied populations (Oceanian, Central/South Asian, Latino), the *1 frequency will deviate even more from true values.

Diplotype/Phenotype frequency estimates. Diplotype and phenotype frequencies were estimated using the equation describing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium based on reported allele frequencies. When calculating diplotype frequencies from these allele frequencies, the margin of error is compounded based on the margin of error on each allele in the diplotype. So, the margin of error will necessarily increase for diplotype frequency estimates compared to allele frequency estimates. For allele frequencies with already large margins of error due to small and non-random sampling, the diplotype margin of error could potentially be quite large. On the other hand, for well-studied alleles, the margin of error is likely low.

Biogeographical groups. Biogeographical groups are derived from PMID 30506572. Further details, including the definitions of each group, can be found at https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/biogeographicalGroups. We strongly recommend that users use either the publication or the PharmGKB link provided to familiarize themselves with the grouping system before using these allele frequencies. These tables group individuals from particular geographic locations into larger biogeographical groups. It is difficult to group populations with certainty, because some populations are often admixed, or at the least, a combination of different ethnicities. Therefore, the margin of error is increased when different subpopulations are grouped together."
